# Weather-Dashboard
This program takes user input of a city's name and utilizes openWeatherAPI to fetch weather data for the city and displays it on the dashboard.
It also provides the weather data for the next 5 days.
A search history is saved in local storage, and it creates buttons of previously serached cities that will also search the city weather information
associated to the button.
